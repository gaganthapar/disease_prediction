In an era where Machine Learning and Deep Learning are experiencing substantial growth, it is crucial to recognize that this advanced knowledge must be applied meaningfully across various fields to truly benefit humanity.

This project harnesses the power of deep learning effectively by deploying it within the medical field. The primary goal is to simplify the tasks of healthcare professionals. Our dataset comprises 132 parameters, facilitating the prediction of 42 distinct diseases.

We are evaluating the performance of two deep learning models on a provided test dataset within the framework of this project. This not only demonstrates the practical application of theoretical knowledge but also aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in medical practice.
